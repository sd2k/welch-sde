/// the signal length `n` is `n=kl - (k-1)la`.
///
/// The minimum number of segment is chosen to be `k=4`, and the segment length is derived
/// from `l = trunc(n/(k(1-a)+a))`.

/// Each segment of length `l` is  multiplied by the predetermined window and zero--padded
/// to the size `m = 2^p` where `p=ceil(log2(l))`.

/// If with only 4 segments (`k=4`), `l` is greater than 4096, then `l` is set to 4096 and
/// the increased number of segments is derived from `k=(n-la)/(l(1-a))`.
